# Manpower Planning - A Supply Chain Optimization Project

## Abstract
In various manufacturing and service industries, staffing challenges are widespread and involve challenging choices related to hiring, training, downsizing, and work scheduling. In this case, we aim to address a complex staffing issue by developing an optimal multi-period operational strategy that reduces both the overall number of layoffs and associated costs.

A company is changing how it runs its business, and therefore its staffing needs are expected to change. Through the purchase of new machinery, a company is expecting\
reduced need for unskilled labor and more need for skilled and semi-skilled labor. Also, a lower sales forecast ⁠- driven by an economic slowdown that is predicted to happen in the next year ⁠- is expected to further reduce labor needs across all categories.\
● If the company’s objective is to minimize layoffs, what plan should they adopt in order to do this?\
● If their objective is to minimize costs, how much could they further reduce costs?\
● How can they determine the annual savings possible across each job?
